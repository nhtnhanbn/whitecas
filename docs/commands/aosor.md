aosor(*f*, *x*, *a*, *b*)

- *f* is an expression in terms of *x*
- *x* is a variable name
- *a* is the *x*-value of the starting point
- *b* is the *x*-value of the ending point

Returns the area of the surface obtained by rotating the graph of *f* between *x* = *a* and *x* = *b* around the *x*-axis.

### Example

Find the area of the surface of revolution obtained by rotating the graph of $$ y = x^2 $$ between $$ x=0 $$ and $$ x=2 $$ around the $$ x $$-axis.
