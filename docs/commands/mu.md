description: expected value of a continuous probability distribution

---

mu(*f*, *x*, *a*, *b*)

- *f* is an expression in terms of *x*
- *x* is a variable name
- *a* is the *x*-value of the starting point
- *b* is the *x*-value of the ending point

For fastest calculation time, the domain [*a*, *b*] should be as small as possible.

**If *f* is a piecewise function it should be entered raw not as a user-defined function.**

**The integral of *f* over the domain [*a*, *b*] must equal 1, as this is assumed by the mu function.**

Returns the mean of the continuous probability distribution defined by the probability density function *f* over the domain [*a*, *b*].

### Example

Find the expected value of $$ t $$ for the probability density function

$$ \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\dfrac{3}{50} \left( \dfrac{t}{50} \right) ^ 2 e^{ - \left( \tfrac{t}{50} \right) ^ 3 } & t \geq 0 \\
\ 0 & t < 0 \end{array}
\right. $$
