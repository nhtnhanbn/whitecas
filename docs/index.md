## Installation

### Update

It is probably a good idea to update your calculator first to the latest version. Use a search engine to find update files from an official Casio website.

Check the current version number on your calculator through Menu (at the bottom), MENU (at the top), Version.

### Backup

The calculator should be backed up to an external device before downloading files from this site.

To back up the calculator, go to Menu (at the bottom), MENU (at the top), Save As, Save. This saves a copy of your data as a file on your calculator.

You should also save a backup copy to a computer. Connect the calculator to the computer with the USB cable. On the calculator, when it asks to Select Connection Mode, select USB Flash. On the computer, drag or copy/paste any file, such as a .vcp backup, from the calculator drive to a local drive on the computer or another USB drive, and the file will be copied to wherever you dropped it.

Ensure that you safely eject the calculator USB from your computer before the cable is disconnected.

This allows you to restore the calculator's files if anything goes wrong. The calculator should be backed up regularly, especially after making major changes to files.

### Download

[Download]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) the files you want to your computer. Unzip if you download a .zip package.

Connect the calculator to the computer with the USB cable. On the calculator, when it asks to Select Connection Mode, select USB Flash. On the computer, drag or copy/paste the .xcp downloads from the computer to the calculator drive.

Ensure that you safely eject the calculator USB from your computer before the cable is disconnected.

On the calculator, go to Menu (at the bottom), System application (on the 2nd page of the menu), under the Storage tab View Storage & Import, Select, tick the files you want to download, Import. Select the folder you want to add the files to (I suggest the library folder for "variables", which are the functions and programs, as this allows you to run all commands by the name of the command alone without specifying the path, and also adds functions to the Catalog on the soft keyboard), then press OK.

### Run commands

Functions and programs can be run in the Main application if the commands are stored in the same folder as your current folder or in the "library" folder (see the Variable Manager). For syntax, see the [commands reference]({{ '/docs/commands' | relative_url }}).

eActvities can be used in the eActivity application through File, Open.

If execution of any command, including builtin calculator functions, is taking too long or forever, break execution by pressing the Clear button on the calculator's hard keyboard.
