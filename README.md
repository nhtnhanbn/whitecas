Site maintained by [Nhan](https://nhtnhanbn.github.io).

Custom commands for the Casio ClassPad II designed especially for VCE Mathematical Methods, Specialist Mathematics to be added in the future.

All commands were written by the contributors, but may have been inspired by others.
I cannot fully guarantee no harm or damage as a result of the files or advice on the site, nor can I guarantee that commands will be always correct or bug-free.

Free to use, copy and modify, but please be decent and play fair.

Why free? Only our unbounded benevolence.
