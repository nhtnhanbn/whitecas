## Casio ClassPad II Custom Commands

Welcome! This site hosts a collection of custom commands (functions and programs) for the Casio ClassPad II (white CAS). These commands have helped students to achieve high study scores for VCE Mathematical Methods and Specialist Mathematics, with one of our major contributors now a Mathematics student at the University of Cambridge. Hopefully you too will find them helpful.

If you encounter any bugs, please [email Nhan](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com).

What is the point of using custom commands?
- Streamline tedious/multiple-step tasks.
- Simpler syntax minimises risk of mistakes.
- Double check answers obtained by alternative Mathematical Methods.

The downloads from this site will not alone lead to success. Try not to turn them into black boxes! These custom commands must replace neither mathematical understanding nor general calculator competency, and hopefully users will also understand how each of the commands basically operate.

This is especially important as we cannot fully guarantee no harm or damage as a result of the files or advice on the site, nor can we guarantee that commands will be always correct or bug-free. If you find any bugs please [email Nhan](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com) or submit an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/nhtnhanbn/whitecas).
