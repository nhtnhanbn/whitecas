## Casio ClassPad II Custom Commands

Welcome! This site hosts a collection of custom commands (functions and programs) for the Casio ClassPad II (white CAS). These commands have helped students to achieve high study scores for VCE Mathematical Methods, and hopefully you too will find them helpful.

If you find encounter any bugs, please [email me](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com).

What is the point of using custom commands?
- Streamline tedious/multiple-step tasks.
- Simpler syntax minimises risk of mistakes.
- Double check answers obtained by alternative Mathematical Methods.

The downloads from this site will not alone lead to success. Try not to turn them into black boxes! These custom commands must replace neither mathematical understanding nor general calculator competency, and hopefully users will also understand how each of the commands basically operate.

Other indispensable resources include the Classpad II [User's Guide](https://support.casio.com/storage/en/manual/pdf/EN/004/ClassPadII_UG_EN.pdf), [Examples](https://support.casio.com/storage/en/manual/pdf/EN/004/ClassPadII_Ex_EN.pdf) and [data management guide](https://casioeducation.com.au/wp-content/uploads/guides/Data_Management_on_the_CASIO_Classpad_II.pdf), as well as Charlie Watson's [Help Series](http://www.classpad.com.au/cp2/index.php) and [custom commands](https://charliewatson.com/casio/cpintro.php).
