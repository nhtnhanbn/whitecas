## Contributions are welcome

If you have written or know about a useful function, program or eActivity that you are willing to make freely available, do [email Nhan](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com) a source file or post of it. Even if it seems trivial or basic it is still welcome if it is beneficial, indeed several of the commands that have been uploaded are quite simple. Authors of files will receive due credit.

If you have any ideas or improvements, do [email Nhan](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com) or submit something on [GitHub](https://github.com/nhtnhanbn/whitecas). You will, particularly if you author any code adopted, receive due credit.
