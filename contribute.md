title: Contribute YOUR Commands

## Contributions are welcome

The white CAS, being the inferior calculator compared to the black and blue CASes, suffers not only from worse performance/capability but also a dearth of resources, especially custom functions/programs. I hope that this site is able to make some small improvement to that situation.

If you have written or know about a useful function, program or eActivity that you are willing to make freely available, do [email me](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com) a source file or post of it. Even if it seems trivial or basic it is still welcome if it is beneficial, indeed several of the commands that I have written and uploaded are quite simple. Authors of files that are not mine will receive due credit.

If you have any ideas or improvements, do [email me](mailto:nhtnhanbn@gmail.com). You will, particularly if you author any code adopted, receive due credit.

Or submit an issue on GitHub or something. I may or may not realise if you do so.
